# BlockchainIoTEcosystem

“Blockchain” is a buzzword that has captured attention from researchers in almost every possible domain. In a blockchain ecosystem, multiple parties across the network have to establish trust in an untrusted environment to ensure seamless nonrepudiation. Nonrepudiation is a crucial factor for secure information auditing in the blockchain. To achieve this, we require an optimal digital signature. In this work, we design a digital signature to address the nonrepudiation challenge in blockchain ecosystems. Our approach developed in the current work completed signing and verification tasks with 10% and 13% shorter processing times, respectively than the conventional digital signature scheme. The adoption of the high-performance Edwards curve aggregate signature (HECAS) in a blockchain ecosystem can yield a 10% improvement in the transaction flow, a 10% improvement in block validation and a 40% decrease in storage costs relative to the same system implemented without HECAS. Finally, we simulated various blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems and experimented with our scheme. The results show that our work can produce convincing, consistent results across various sensor data types from smart IoT-based blockchain solutions.
