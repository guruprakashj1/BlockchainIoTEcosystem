# High-performance Edwards curve aggregate signature (HECAS) for nonrepudiation in IoT-based applications built on the blockchain ecosystem

Blockchain is a technology that has gained widespread attention across various domains. In a blockchain network, multiple parties need to establish trust to ensure secure information auditing. To achieve this, an optimal digital signature is required. This work presents a new digital signature solution that addresses the nonrepudiation challenge in blockchain ecosystems. The proposed solution demonstrates faster processing times for signing and verification tasks compared to conventional digital signatures. The adoption of the high-performance Edwards curve aggregate signature (HECAS) in a blockchain network can lead to improved transaction flow, block validation and decreased storage costs. The proposed solution has been tested and simulated in various blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems and has produced consistent results across different sensor data types.

# EC-ElGamal and Genetic Algorithm-Based Enhancement for Lightweight Scalable Blockchain in IoT Domain
The Internet of Things (IoT) domain faces significant challenges with regards to security, data privacy and decentralization. However, these challenges align with the attributes of another emerging technology, Blockchain. As such, there has been an increased interest in exploring the potential of Blockchain in solving these challenges within the IoT domain. To enable the rapid adoption of IoT, there is a need for standardized and secure solutions. This has led to the development of various blockchain solutions, including Lightweight Scalable Blockchain (LSB). This paper focuses on improving the security and performance of LSB through encryption of transaction transmission, optimization of transaction flow, block validation, hash quality, hash rate and storage cost. The proposed improvements have been tested using data from temperature sensors, with results demonstrating the superior applicability of the proposed solution in the IoT domain. The implementation and comparison with conventional LSB shows a significant improvement in security and performance, including an additional layer of encryption, a reduction in transaction processing time and block validation processing time, and an improvement in hash quality and storage cost.
